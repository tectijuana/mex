AI agents forget everything between sessions. mex gives them permanent, navigable project memory so every session starts with the right context instead of a cold prompt dump.

```bash
npx mex-agent setup
```

## Why mex?

Most agent memory setups become one giant instruction file. That works for a while, then it floods the context window, burns tokens, and drifts away from the real codebase.

| Without mex | With mex |
|-------------|----------|
| Giant `CLAUDE.md` / rules files | Small anchor file plus routed context |
| Agents forget decisions and conventions | Decisions, patterns, and project state persist |
| Docs silently drift from code | `mex check` catches stale or broken scaffold claims |
| Every session starts cold | Agents load only the files relevant to the task |
| Repeated work stays tribal | New patterns grow from real tasks |

## What It Does

mex creates a structured markdown scaffold for agent memory:

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — tiny tool-loaded anchor
- `ROUTER.md` — routing table for task-specific context
- `context/` — architecture, stack, setup, decisions, conventions
- `patterns/` — reusable task guides with gotchas and verification steps
- `.mex/events/decisions.jsonl` — append-only notes through `mex log`

The CLI keeps that scaffold honest. It checks paths, commands, dependencies, pattern indexes, staleness, and script coverage without spending AI tokens. When drift appears, `mex sync` builds targeted prompts so the agent fixes only the stale pieces.

## Quick Start

The npm package is named `mex-agent` because `mex` was already taken. The CLI command is still `mex`.

```bash
npx mex-agent setup
```

Setup creates the `.mex/` scaffold, asks which AI tool you use, pre-scans your codebase, and generates a targeted prompt to populate the memory files. It takes about five minutes.

At the end of setup, you can install mex globally:

```bash
mex check        # drift score
mex sync         # fix drift
```

If you skip global install, use npx:

```bash
npx mex-agent check
npx mex-agent sync
```

Install globally later at any time:

```bash
npm install -g mex-agent
```

### Windows

The recommended `npx mex-agent setup` flow runs in any terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or WSL) and does not need bash, so most Windows users do not have to think about this section.

> **Windows users (legacy `setup.sh` flow):** Run all commands inside WSL or Git Bash. Do not mix environments.

If you previously installed via the legacy `setup.sh` script, building inside WSL and then running the CLI from a native Windows terminal causes "module not found" errors because `node_modules` and path resolution differ between the two filesystems. Run install, build, and CLI commands inside the same environment: either entirely in WSL / Git Bash, or entirely in native Windows via `npx mex-agent`.

See [issue #10](https://github.com/theDakshJaitly/mex/issues/10) for context.

## How It Works

![mex context routing flow](docs/diagrams/context-routing.svg)

The agent starts with a tiny auto-loaded file. That file points to `ROUTER.md`, and the router loads only the context needed for the current task. After meaningful work, the GROW step updates project state, decisions, and task patterns so the scaffold becomes more useful over time.

## Drift Detection

Eleven checkers validate your scaffold against the real codebase. Zero tokens, zero AI.

| Checker | What it catches |
|---------|----------------|
| **path** | Referenced file paths that do not exist on disk |
| **edges** | YAML frontmatter edge targets pointing to missing files |
| **index-sync** | `patterns/INDEX.md` out of sync with actual pattern files |
| **staleness** | Scaffold files not updated in 30+ days or 50+ commits |
| **command** | `npm run X` / `make X` references scripts that do not exist |
| **dependency** | Claimed dependencies missing from `package.json` |
| **cross-file** | Same dependency with different versions across files |
| **script-coverage** | `package.json` scripts not mentioned in any scaffold file |
| **tool-config-sync** | Installed AI tool config files (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`) out of sync with each other |
| **todo-fixme** | Unresolved `TODO` / `FIXME` markers left in scaffold markdown |
| **broken-link** | Markdown links to local files that do not exist on disk |

Scoring starts at 100. mex deducts 10 per error, 3 per warning, and 1 per info.

## Commands

All commands run from your project root. If you did not install globally, replace `mex` with `npx mex-agent`.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `mex` | Open the interactive terminal dashboard |
| `mex tui` | Open the interactive terminal dashboard explicitly |

| `mex setup --mode agent-memory` | Create templates for persistent-agent / homelab memory workspaces |
| `mex setup --dry-run` | Preview what setup would do without making changes |
| `mex check` | Run drift checkers and output a scored report |
| `mex check --quiet` | One-liner: `mex: drift score 92/100 (1 warning)` |
| `mex check --json` | Full report as JSON |
| `mex check --fix` | Check and jump straight to sync if errors are found |
| `mex sync` | Detect drift, choose mode, let AI fix, verify, repeat |
| `mex sync --dry-run` | Preview targeted prompts without executing |
| `mex sync --warnings` | Include warning-only files in sync |
| `mex init` | Pre-scan codebase and build a structured brief for AI |
| `mex init --json` | Raw scanner brief as JSON |
| `mex log <message>` | Append a note, decision, risk, or todo |

```

## Real World Results

Independently tested by a community member on **OpenClaw** across 10 structured homelab scenarios covering Ubuntu 24.04, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, networking, and monitoring. 10/10 tests passed. Drift score: 100/100.

| Scenario | Without mex | With mex | Saved |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| "How does K8s work?" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,450 tokens | 56% |
| "Open UFW port" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,050 tokens | 68% |
| "Explain Docker" | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,100 tokens | 67% |
| Multi-context query | ~3,300 tokens | ~1,650 tokens | 50% |

**~60% average token reduction per session.**

## Agent Memory Mode

`mex setup --mode agent-memory` creates a scaffold for persistent agents whose "project" is an operational environment rather than a code repo. It adds a `HEARTBEAT.md` contract and templates that frame mex as structured, task-routed memory:

- `ROUTER.md` tracks current operational state and routes the agent to the right memory files.
- `context/` stores architecture, stack, conventions, setup, and decisions.
- `patterns/` stores recurring runbooks.
- `.mex/events/decisions.jsonl` stores append-only notes and rationale through `mex log`.

`mex heartbeat` is intentionally lighter than `mex check`: it reads `last_updated` frontmatter and memory cleanup metadata, prints `HEARTBEAT_OK` when clean, and reports only when the agent needs to review stale context or memory files. Use `mex watch --interval` to run heartbeat repeatedly in a persistent-agent workspace.

## Configuration

Optional settings live in `.mex/config.json`. Missing values fall back to defaults.

```json
{
  "staleness": {
    "warnDays": 30,
    "errorDays": 90,
    "warnCommits": 50,
    "errorCommits": 200
  },
  "heartbeat": {
    "staleDays": 7,
    "memoryCleanupDays": 7,
    "dailyMemoryRetentionDays": 14
  },
  "watch": {
    "intervalMinutes": 30
  }
}
```

## Telemetry

mex collects anonymous, opt-out usage data (command name, version, OS — never paths, args, file contents, IP, or personal data) to understand how the tool is used. Audit the exact payload with `mex telemetry inspect`, and opt out any time with `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, `MEX_TELEMETRY=0`, or `mex config set telemetry off`. Full details: [TELEMETRY.md](TELEMETRY.md).

## Ecosystem

mex is provider-neutral. Integration guides, sponsored examples, and community recipes should be useful on their own, clearly labeled, and live in docs rather than silently changing the default experience.
