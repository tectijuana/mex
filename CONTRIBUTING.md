# Contributing to mex

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

**New here?** The best starting point is an issue labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/theDakshJaitly/mex/labels/good%20first%20issue) — most are self-contained drift checkers, and there are 11 existing checkers to copy from. See [Adding a drift checker](#adding-a-drift-checker) below.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theDakshJaitly/mex.git
cd mex
npm install
npm run build
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # watch mode — rebuilds on changes
npm run test:watch   # run tests in watch mode
npm run typecheck    # type check without emitting
```

## Before submitting a PR

1. Run the full check suite:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build
   ```
2. Keep changes focused — one fix or feature per PR.
3. Add tests for new checkers or bug fixes when possible.
4. Don't refactor surrounding code unless that's the point of the PR.

## Adding a drift checker

New checkers are the most newcomer-friendly contribution. A checker is a small function that inspects scaffold files (or extracted claims) and returns `DriftIssue[]`. There are 11 existing checkers in `src/drift/checkers/` — pick the closest as a template.

1. **Create `src/drift/checkers/<name>.ts`.** There are two shapes:
   - **Claim-based** — operates on extracted claims, e.g. `checkPaths(claims, projectRoot, scaffoldRoot)` in `path.ts`.
   - **Structural** — operates on the scaffold directly, e.g. `checkIndexSync(projectRoot, scaffoldRoot)` in `index-sync.ts`.

   Return a `DriftIssue[]`:
   ```ts
   {
     code,                        // an IssueCode (see step 2)
     severity,                    // "error" | "warning" | "info"
     file,                        // scaffold file the issue is in
     line,                        // number | null
     message,
     claim?,                      // the claim that triggered it, if any
   }
   ```
2. **Add your `code` to the `IssueCode` union in `src/types.ts`.** It's a closed union — the build fails until your code is listed there.
3. **Register the checker in `src/drift/index.ts`:** import it, invoke it in the matching block (the per-file loop for per-file checks, or the claim/structural sections), and push its result count to `checkerIssueCounts`.
4. **Add tests to `test/checkers.test.ts`** — cover both a triggering case and a clean case.
5. **Run `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build`** before opening the PR.
